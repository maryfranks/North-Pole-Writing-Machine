Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for Sydney's Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

Sydney's Toy Order

$1000	Skates
$1000	Soldier
$0		Kaleidoscope (out of stock)
$1000	Robot
$1000	Uno
$1000	Monopoly
----
$5000	Subtotal
$130		Tax
====
$1130	 Total

Your total comes to $565. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of Sydney's toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
Collections Department
Santa's Village
