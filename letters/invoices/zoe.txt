Attention: Zoe's Parents

Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for Zoe's Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

=================

$100	Defective Toy
----
$100	Subtotal
$13		Tax
====
$113	 Total

Your total comes to $565. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of Zoe's toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
Collections Department
Santa's Village

P.S. For a limited time get 25% off the best-seller by Ms. Claus, Iâ€™m Getting Nothing for Christmas: Raising Toy-Worthy Children in a Device-Driven World.
