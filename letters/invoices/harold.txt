Attention: Harold's Parents

Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for Harold's Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

$100	Barbie
$100	Slinky
$100	Clue
$100	Plane
$100	Pony
$100	Risk

$600	Subtotal
$13		Tax
====
$113	 Total

Your total comes to $565. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of Harold's toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
Collections Department
Santa's Village
